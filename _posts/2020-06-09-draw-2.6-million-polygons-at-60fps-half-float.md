In this article we are going to use [Half](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Half) data type from Android platform and also explore the caveats of it.

In [last article]({{site.url}}/draw-2.6-million-polygons-at-60fps-optimize) we rendered full L2 dataset at 60 FPS, however, [Romain Guy](https://twitter.com/romainguy) suggested a very tempting optimization on this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ioznz0/drawing_millions_of_polygons_at_60_fps_in_android/g4hcbnf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This was pretty interesting to me as I wasn't aware of existence of such a class in Android Framework.

[Half](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Half) data type is essentially a `Float` datatype *stored* in `Short` datatype. Confusing? Here is what [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Half) says
> A half-precision float can be created from or converted to single-precision floats, and is stored in a short data type. 

What this means is that `Half` is not a primitive data type like `Float` or `Short` its *like a wrapper/utility* class over `Short` type which does some bit magic to store `exponent` and `significand` in 16 bits space. This also means that it offers less precision, same document also lists available precision ranges for numbers ranging between 1/16,384 to 32,768. 

# Since latitude or longitude will only vary between [-180, -180] we will get lowest precision somewhere between (1/8, 1/4) or (0.125, 0.25).
In theory, we can save 50% of GPU memory if we can store our vertices in a `HalfBuffer` or more practically speaking  a `ShortBuffer`. This should also reduce GPU data transfer times. Before we weigh in on pros and cons of using `Half`, lets implement this see the output.

## Implementation

As stated before, `Half` are stored in `Short`s natively, hence we need to store all vertex coordinates in a `ShortArray`. Since mathematical operations are not supported yet we do all calculations in `Float` and convert final value to `Half` using `toHalf()` extension method. Then Half provides a convenient method [`halfValue()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Half#halfValue()) which as documentation states
> Returns the half-precision value of this Half as a short containing the bit representation described in Half.

Which means that we now have a `half precision Float` value stored in a Short data type. This `ShortArray` can be converted to `ByteBuffer` just like we were converting `FloatArray` before. Here is [new implementation of `generateVertexData()`](https://github.com/abhishekBansal/nexrad-render/pull/8/files#diff-44837ae35289cf02beac5bfc4273da5bR125) method. I will be talking about performance in later part of this article.

As for drawing `OpenGL ES` added support for half precision floats in `OpenGL ES Version 3`. I had to bump usage of `GLES20` to `GLES30`. Rest of the [`draw()`](https://github.com/abhishekBansal/nexrad-render/pull/8/files#diff-44837ae35289cf02beac5bfc4273da5bR95) method remains same except for we now specify data type as `GL_HALF_FLOAT` where ever it was `GL_FLOAT`. 

That's it! Here are before and after images of L2 rendering

Does this look good? We will take a closer look at that, but, here is complete implementation of [Reflectivity Layer with Half](https://github.com/abhishekBansal/nexrad-render/blob/use_half_data_type/app/src/main/java/dev/abhishekbansal/nexrad/layers/ReflectivityLayerHalfFloat.kt) data type for now.
