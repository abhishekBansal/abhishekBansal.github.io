In this article we are going to use [Half](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Half) data type from Android platform and also explore the caveats of it.

In [last article]({{site.url}}/draw-2.6-million-polygons-at-60fps-optimize) we rendered full L2 dataset at 60 FPS, however, [Romain Guy](https://twitter.com/romainguy) suggested a very tempting optimization on this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ioznz0/drawing_millions_of_polygons_at_60_fps_in_android/g4hcbnf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This was pretty interesting to me as I wasn't aware of existence of such a class in Android Framework.

[Half](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Half) data type is essentially a `Float` datatype *stored* in `Short` datatype. Confusing? Here is what [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Half) says
> A half-precision float can be created from or converted to single-precision floats, and is stored in a short data type. 

What this means is that `Half` is not a primitive data type like `Float` or `Short` its *like a wrapper/utility* class over Short which does some bit magic to store `exponent` and `significand` in 16 bits that Short offers. This also means that it offers less precision, same document also lists available precision ranges for numbers ranging between 1/16,384 to 32,768. Since latitude or longitude will only vary between [-180, -180] we will get lowest precision somewhere between (1/8, 1/4) or (0.125, 0.25)
